# First Challange
    This challenge was made with the intention to see the 
    evolution of the same code through time while improving 
    the knowledge in the language and in software engineering

## What to develop?
    A simple calculator with 4 operations that are
    executed in loop, show your user what they can do

## Rules
> + The four operations are: +, -, / and 
> + The user must be able to choose one of them
> + Loop the execution
> + The results of the sum must be shown on the shell(terminal)
> + When you finish the code, try to make it smarter and as scalable as possible (Polishing is the key)
> + See its evolution at the end of the process comparing the first code with the most recent one

### Material to study

> [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp "W3Schools's python introduction page") has a great tutorial for python, I highly recommend it.
